Risk analysis can also help plan and prepare for mitigating or avoiding these issues. Scope change is a modification of the original goals, requirements or deliverables of a project or an activity. Scope change is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to reflect changes in expectations or needs of the stakeholders. End-user acceptance is a measure of how well the users are satisfied with and adopt a new system or service. End-user acceptance is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the change. Rollback plan is a contingency plan that describes how to restore a system or service to its previous state in case of a failed or problematic change implementation. Rollback plan is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to recover from them.

The technician determines the computer needs to be taken off site for repair. Which of the following should the technician do NEXT?","Options":{"A":"Remove the HDD and then send the computer for repair.","B":"Check corporate polices for guidance.","C":"Delete the sensitive information before the computer leaves the building.","D":"Get authorization from the manager."},"Answer":"D","Explanation":"The next step that the technician should do before taking the computer off site for repair is to get authorization from the manager. Getting authorization from the manager is important because it ensures that the technician has permission and approval to remove the computer from the premises and perform the repair work off site. Getting authorization from the manager can also help document and communicate the reason and duration of the repair and avoid any misunderstanding or conflict with the user or the organization. Removing the HDD and then sending the computer for repair may not be feasible or necessary if the issue is not related to the HDD or if the HDD contains essential data or software for the repair. Checking corporate policies for guidance may be a good step but it does not replace getting authorization from the manager who is responsible for the computer and its data. Deleting the sensitive information before the computer leaves the building may not be possible or advisable if the issue prevents access to the data or if the data is needed for troubleshooting or recovery purposes.

The data plan coverage may vary depending on the user's location, carrier and subscription.25 The data plan coverage may not include or support certain areas or countries that the user is traveling to, or may charge extra fees or limit the speed or amount of data that the user can use. The data plan coverage does not affect text messages and phone calls, which use different network services and protocols. User account status is not likely to cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, unless the user account has been suspended or terminated by the carrier or the email provider. Mobile OS version is not likely to cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, unless the mobile OS has a major bug or compatibility problem with the network or the email app. Network traffic outages may cause the issue of not being able to receive emails or browse the internet from a smartphone while traveling, but they are less likely and less common than data plan coverage issues, and they should also affect text messages and phone calls.
