Getting authorization from the manager is important because it ensures that the technician has permission and approval to remove the computer from the premises and perform the repair work off site. Getting authorization from the manager can also help document and communicate the reason and duration of the repair and avoid any misunderstanding or conflict with the user or the organization. Removing the HDD and then sending the computer for repair may not be feasible or necessary if the issue is not related to the HDD or if the HDD contains essential data or software for the repair. Checking corporate policies for guidance may be a good step but it does not replace getting authorization from the manager who is responsible for the computer and its data. Deleting the sensitive information before the computer leaves the building may not be possible or advisable if the issue prevents access to the data or if the data is needed for troubleshooting or recovery purposes.
